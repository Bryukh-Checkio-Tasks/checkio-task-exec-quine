    "If, however, in our perversity we are still bent on constructing
    a sentence that does attribute falsity unequivocally to itself, we can do so thus:
    <br><br>
    `Yields a falsehood when appended to its own quotation` yields a falsehood when appended to its own quotation.
    <br>
    <br>

    This sentence specifies a string of nine words and says of this string that if you put it down twice,
    with quotation marks around the first of the two occurrences, the result is false.
    But that result is the very sentence that is doing the telling. The sentence is true if and only if it is false,
    and we have our antinomy."<br>

    A quine is a computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output.
    The standard terms for these programs in the computability theory and computer science literature are
    "self-replicating programs", "self-reproducing programs", and "self-copying programs".

<p>
    You should implement a function which should be named "quine" which will reproduce itself with environment.
    Lets call your entire code as ANSWER_CODE and this code contain quine function definition.
    If we will exec <strong>quine()</strong>, then result should be a string which is equaled by ANSWER_CODE.
    You can check this in your local environment with
    <pre class="brush: python">exec(ANSWER_CODE);quine().</pre>
</p>
<p>
    In this mission only one test and be careful with newlines, tabs and whitespaces,
    because we will compare ANSWER_CODE and function result as they are.
    In this mission the main goal is an original creativity solution and
    votes from other users, because this mission has increased exp points for publication votes.

    <strong>Input: </strong> Nothing.

    <strong>Output: </strong> The code as a string.
